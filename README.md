# TypicalMath
An implementation of a type theory and proof checker.
 The supporting theory is introduced in 
 [this column (Chinese)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/typical-math).

## Type system

## Parsing system

## [Deprecated] Python

This part contains python code that I abandoned :(

## Miscellaneous Components

This part is stored in the `/Misc` directory. It contains the
code used for demonstration purposes in the column.

The `/Misc/LambdaCalculus` folder contains an implementation of
simply typed and untyped lambda calculus. It also contains a
fun implementation of the [Iota and Jot language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_and_Jot).

The `/Misc/unification` folder contains a demonstrative system
of a unification algorithm.
